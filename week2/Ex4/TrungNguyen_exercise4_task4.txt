a. Histogram equalization purpose is to stretch the image contrast in order to make the pixel intensity 
distribution become more equal through out all values (e.g: 0 - 255), which result in linear cummulation 
distribution function. After achieving the equal probaility distribution, applying equalization wont make any effect.

b. Because for digital image we cannot achieving the continuous distribution function as the discretion of pixel value.
Hence, the difference in original intensity distribution of the image will effect on the last result.
For images like moon and spine when almost half of pixels are in the same value or too less difference, I will devide the image into equal batches and equalize batch separately
