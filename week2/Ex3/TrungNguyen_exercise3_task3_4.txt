Task 3:
When you go in the bright place, during this time cones cells will mainly active because it's sensitive to color.
When you go from a bright place to a dark theater, rods cells will gradually become active, replace for cones.
Rods cells cannot sense the color, but only the shape of object and responsible for vision at low light level.
This is the reason why your eyes need times to adapt when you change from bright to dark place or vice versa.

Task 4:
a. Depend on value of c.
    If c is negative, we will see the histogram moves to the left on intensity axis (x-axis)
    If c is positive, we will see the histogram moves to the left on intensity axis (x-axis)

b. Depend on value of c (constrant: c > 0).
    If c < 1, we will see the histogram shrinks its range to c times to the left on intensity axis (x-axis)
    and stretch 1/c times on probability axis (y-axis)
        For example: c = 0.5, in the original image, value 254 has 1000 pixels and 255 has 1000 pixels.
        In the new image, value 127 will has 2000 pixels
    
    If c = 1, nothing will change

    If c > 1, we will see the histogram moves to the right on intensity axis (x-axis) and larger probability
    for large intensity due to the value clipping
        For example: c = 2, original image has 1000 pixels with value 255 and 1000 pixels with value 150, new image
        will have 2000 pixels with value 255

c. histogram is rotate-invariant, so rotating image by 90 degree clockwise doesn't make any change to histogram.
